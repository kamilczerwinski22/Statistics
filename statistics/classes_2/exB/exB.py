# A script where starting from Markov chain node we draw the probability of passing from one node to another
# according to the given probability matrix (made from Markov chain). We do this many times. In the end we check how
# many times we visited each node.
# The pi values show a steady state drive.
# Script will show experimental results (theoretical results in script A).
