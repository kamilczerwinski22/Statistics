# A script where we have N amount of users and N amount of states. Probability to log in = 0.2, probability to log out
# = 0.5. We simulate the trajectory - at each iteration each user have a change to be logged in or logged out (
# depending on users current state). We need to construct convergence graph.
# Values of Pi show the pursuit of a value to a stationary state.
# e.g.: At first we have state 0, because all users are logged out. After one iteration 5 users logged in - current
# state is 5, and so on. On the graph we show can show selected states.
