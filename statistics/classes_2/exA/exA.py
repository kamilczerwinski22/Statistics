# A script where for a given probability matrix (made from a markov chain)
# multiply it by itself N times until a convergence criterion is found (each successive
# multiplication yields very small changes), e.g. |P^n - P^(n-1)| < 10^(-5).
# The pi values show a steady state drive.
# Script will show theoretical results (experimental results in script B).
