# A script where we have N amount of users and N amount of states (same as exC but with different logging probability).
# Probabilities:
# Log in = 0.2
# Stay logged out = 0.8
# Log out = 1 - (0.008 * current state + 0.1)
# Stay logged in = 0.008 * current state + 0.1
# We simulate the trajectory - at each iteration each user have a change to be logged in or logged out (depending on
# users current state). We need to construct convergence graph.
# Values of Pi show the pursuit of a value to a stationary state.
# e.g.: At first we have state 0, because all users are logged out. After one iteration 5 users logged in - current
# state is 5, and so on. On the graph we show can show selected states.
