# Script that calculates population by state policy. Initial values are:
# - probability of boy being born,
# - probability of girl being born,
# - starting population,
# - percentage of fertility of the couples formed
# A simulation of two policies (one child, one son) of population control for 10 generations is created. Situation
# similar to exD, but this time some of the couples break the law and have 6 children, regardless of policy.
# Script generates graphs of the number of people depending on the generation number.
