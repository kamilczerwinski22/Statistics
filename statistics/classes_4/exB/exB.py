# Script with a simulation of a given number of dice rolls (or until one of the players goes bankrupt). To win
# player's roll have to be higher than his opponent's (Player's dice roll > opponent's dice roll). Winning gives one
# coin to the player, losing takes one away.
# The script generates experimental and theoretical graphs of the dependence of capital on the number of games.
# The experimental average win per game is also compared to the theoretical value.
